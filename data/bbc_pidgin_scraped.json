      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images US President Donald Trump threat to just enta Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" to stop di killing of \"record numbers of Christians\" no just comot from nowia. For months, campaigners and politicians for Washington don dey tok say Islamist militants just dey plan and target Christinas for Nigeria. For September, popular TV host and comedian, Bill Maher just increase evritin as e describe wetin dey happun as \"genocide\". E refer to di Boko Haram group say \"dem don kill ova 100,000 since 2009 and dem don burn 18,000 churches\". Pipo wit di influence don dey also ginger pipo for social media. Di Nigerian govment for Abuja don push back against dis claims as dem call dem say dem be \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\". Dem no deny say deadly kasala dey happun for di kontri. But officials tok say, \"terrorists dey attack evribodi wey no gree for dia kill-kill ideology - Muslims, Christians and those wey no gey faith join\". Oda groups wey dey torchlight political violence for Nigeria say di numbers of Christians wey dem don kill dey far lower as most of di victims of jihadist groups na Muslims. Nigerian secuirty analyst Christina Ani tok say even though dem dey attack Christians as part of bigger move to create terror, e no dey possible to justify claims say na Christians gan-gan dem dey torchlight. And Nigeria dey face plenty security kasala all ova di kontri and no be just kasala from jihadist groups. And all dis different kasala get different reasons so make dem no dey confused. Di kontri 220 million pipo roughly divide half - half between di two religions. Muslims na dem plenti pass for di north, wia most attacks dey happun. Texas Senator Ted Cruz don dey campaign on top dis mata from time and even tok di kain numbers wey Maher tok on 7 October. E write for X say \"since 2009, ova 50,000 Christians for Nigeria don dey massacred and ova 18,000 churches and 2,000 Christian schools don dey destroyed\". Im office send email wia e clear di air say di senator no dey call am \"genocide\" like Maher but e call am \"persecution\". But Cruz accuse Nigerian officials say dem dey \"ignore and even ginger di murder of Christians by Islamist jihadists\". Trump wey tok di same tin use am call Nigeria say na \"disgraced kontri\", and say di goment \"kontinu to do dey allow di killing of Christians\". Di Nigerian goment don deny am say dem dey do dia best to handle di jihadists. Some officials don also welcome di idea say US go help fight insurgents as long as dem no just run am by demsef. True-true, di authorities don struggle to handle di violent jihadist groups and criminal networks. Dis na as most weeks be like dem dey come wit new new tori of fresh attacks or kidnapping. Boko Haram wey dey known for di kidnapping of di Chibok girls ova 10 years ago, don dey active since 2009 but most of dia work na for di north-east wey gey mostly Muslim population. Oda jihadist groups don also land wey include di Islamic State West Africa Province but dem also dey do dia activities for di north-east. Di numbers of Christian deaths wey some for American dey tok dey scary but to find out weda dem be true, na anoda mata. As to wetin be di souce of dia data, Cruz for one podcast for September, bin refer to one 2023 report by di International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (InterSociety) - wey be non-govmental organisation wey dey torchlight and track human rights abuses across Nigeria. Im office also send BBC some links to online tori on di mata. But most dem bin link back to InterSociety. For data wey fit dey shape US policy for Nigeria, InterSociety work no clear. For report wey dem publish for August, wey combine previous research and updated numbers for 2025, e tok say jihadist groups for Nigeria don kill ova 100,000 Christians for di 16 years since 2009. E also note say 60,000 \"moderate Muslims\" bin also die for dat time. InterSociety no give list of sources wey make am hard to verify di full number of deaths e dey report. To ansa dis criticism, di organisation tok say \"e dey almost impossiple to reproduce all our reports and dia references wey go back to 2010. Our easy method na to pick dia summary statistics and add dem to our fresh discoveries or findings to create our new reports\". But di data sources wey InterSociety dey quote no get di figures wey dem publish. Wia dis foto come from, AFP via Getty Images For di deaths wey happun dis year, InterSociety conclude say between January and August, na just ova 7,000 Christians dey killed. Dis na anoda number wey pipo don dey quote all ova social media. Pipo like  Republican  Congressman Riley M Moore, wey don be leading voice for dis mata for di House of Representatives. InterSociety add list of 70 media houses as some of dia sources for wetin dem find about di attacks on Christians for 2025. But di wahala be say in like half of dis cases, di original news tori no tok anytin about di religion of di victims. For instance, InterSociety bin quote one Al Jazeera report of di attack for north-eastern Nigeria, and tok say according to di news organisation \"no less dan 40 farmers wey be mainly Christians don dey abducted by Boko Haram for Damboa part of Borno State\". But di Al Jazeera tori no tok anytin say di victims na \"mainly Christians\", as InterSociety quote dem say dem tok. InterSociety tell BBC say dem do more analysis to find out wia dem come from. Dem no explain how dem do am for dis situation but dem mention say dem get knowledge of local populations and how dem dey use \"Christian media reports\". But di number of deaths wey dey for di reports wey InterSociety dey quote no reach di total of 7,000 wey dem dey tok. To explain di mata, InterSociety say dem also dey estimate di number of pipo wey dem believe bin die for captivity plus eyewitness testimonies wey dem no fit tok come outside. For dia list of offenders na Islamist militant groups like Boko Haram but also Fulani herders. Di Fulanis na mainly Muslim ethnic group wey dey live all ova West Africa don traditionally dey make money from raising cattle and sheep. Di inclusion of di Fulani herders, wey InterSociety dey call \"jihadists\" for all dia reports na sources of wahala for Nigeria ova how dem dey arrange dis killings. While herders normally be Muslims, many researchers for field reject tok say dia kasala na religious mata. Dem say most of di time, na about how to get land and water. Fulani herders don get kwanta wit both Muslim and Christian communities around Nigeria. Security analyst, Oga Ani dey argue say, \"to say dem be jihadist, na long tin. E no get anytin to di wit dat. Na more about criminal elements\". Confidence McHarry, wey be senior security analyst for Africa-focussed consultancy SBM Intelligence tok say most times di kasala na bicos of ethnic tensions and competition for resources. \"E fit dey ethnic in nature, dem wan grab  lands, expand dia territories, but di more dem dey pursue communities comot and di more dem dey attack worship centres, di more dem go dey look dis kain tins wit dat kain eye\". InterSociety also mention who dem dey call for Nigeria say dem be bandits, dem tok say dem be mostly ethnic Fulanis for di north-west of di kontri wey dey do kidnapping and get history of killing both Christians and Muslims. Wia dis foto come from, Reuters E don tay wey politicians for di United State and international Christian groups don dey tok about dia worry ova threats wey dey face Nigerian Christians. Bifor, for years, na di Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob) wey dey proscribed for Nigeria say dem wan create dia own kontri wit mainly di Christian south-east bin carry di mata go US. Di Nigerian military don accuse InterSociety say dem get link wit Ipob but di NGO say na lie. Anoda Biafran separatist group don also claim say dem play major role for di promotion for di \"Christian Genocide\" tori for di US Congress. Di Biafra Republic Government in Exile, BRGIE call am \"highly orchestrated effort\" say dem hire lobby firms and bin meet US officials plus including Cruz sef. Di senator no gree ansa dat one. InterSociety numbers dey far higher dan oda sources of data about how many Christians don dey killed for Nigeria. Acled, wey dey torchlight violence for West Africa don comot wit differenct numbers. Di sources wey dem get for di published findings dey easy to trace and cross-check. Dia senior analyst, Ladd Stewart don gree address InterSociety reports head on but tell di BBC say di number of 100,000 deaths wey dem dey carry loud am for social media up and down, go include all di acts of political violence for Nigeria and so e no go dey true say na di numbers of Christians wey don die since 2009. Acled find out say na just under 53,000 civilians weda na Christians or Muslims na im don dey reported say dem kill for targeted political kasala since 2009. Acled torchlight just di period from 2020 to September 2025 and tok say na about 21,000 civillians don dey killed for kidnap attacks, sexual kasala and di use of explosives. Dem find 384 times wia Christians bin dey targetted specifically from 2020 to September 2025 wia 317 pipo die, dis mean say dem dey account for small proportions of di pipo wey don dey killed. For dia sources, Acled dey rely on traditional media, social media wia di tori fit dey verified, rights groups plus including local partners. Last Friday, for Truth Social Trump post number of 3,100 Christians wey dem don kill. E bin dey tok about one report wey Open Doors release about di number of deaths for 12 months wey start from October 2023, according to White House official. Open Doors na charity wey dey do research on di persecution of Christians for di world. Dia report say while 3,100 Christians die, dem also kill 2,320 Muslims for dat 12 months. Open Doors also include wetin dem dey call \"Fulani Terror Groups\" for dia list of who dey do am and say dem dey responsible for about one third of di Christians wey dem kill in those 12 months. Senior research fellow for Open Doors, Frans Verrman say \"wetin we dey see now na say Christians still dey targetted but some Muslims don dey increasingly targeted by Fulani militants\".

      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, AFP/Getty Images Nigeria fine new Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) don dey di centre of one political wahala for Edo State di same week wey e suppose open to di public for di first time. Di museum sidon on top six hectares (15 acres) of land for di center of Benin City, wey be Edo State capital for southern Nigeria. Di place include one archaeological dig site and fine buildings wey British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye design, na di same man wey design di National Museum of African American History and Culture wey open for Washington for 2016. Dem don dey work on dis project for five years, and di idea na to celebrate both old and new creativity for di region wey famous for di Benin Bronzes - artworks wey British soldiers carry comot from di Oba palace for 19th century. Before di planned opening, di whole Mowaa building dey shine and full of staff wey wan prove say di museum fit compete wit any top museum or gallery for Western countries. Inside, conservators dey carefully open artworks from protective packaging, check each piece well, and record everything before dem hang am for wall or place am for stands. Technicians dey adjust di climate control system, while officers for dia materials science lab dey set up equipment wey go help preserve artefacts wey don last for hundreds of years. Di project na idea from businessman Phillip Ihenacho, wey now be di executive director of Mowaa. \"I want make we get big economic impact for di communities around here\" e tell BBC, e add say e wan make Benin City turn to \"a cultural destination.\" Mowaa, wey be non-profit Nigerian institution, tok say e plan to create more dan 30,000 direct and indirect jobs and contribute over $80 million (£60m) eviri year to di regional creative economy through partnership and different cultural programs. E don take $25m (£19m) to reach dis level, money wey come from different donors, including di French and German govments, di British Museum, and di Edo State govment. But now, di local govment don withdraw di land wey dem build di museum on top. One Edo State spokesperson tell BBC say di reason be say na sake of say for di original document, di museum call imsef Edo Museum of West African Art, but later di \"Edo\" name comot from di title. Dis announcement hapun afta protests on Sunday, wen pipo storm di campus and demand make dem call am di Benin Royal Museum. One group wey vex insult foreign guests wey come for di opening, forcing police to rush carry di guests comot under escort. President Bola Tinubu don even chook mouth inside di mata to calm everything down, e set up one high-level committee to do damage control. But di question be say how di tin take turn into big politics and one public relations wahala? Evritin dey point to local political fight for Edo State, bicos di former Govnor Godwin Obaseki wey support di museum from day one, na di main person wey push di project before im tenure end last year. Now, di new govnor wey be padi-padi to di Oba of Benin, look like e wan get more control for di museum project. Di protesters on Sunday even demand say di museum must dey under Oba Ewuare II authority. Dis mata don bring back di long argument about di Benin Bronzes one of Africa most famous cultural treasures. Even if di museum finally open, di bronze dem no go still dey inside. Dis na brass, ivory, and wooden sculptures wey dem use to decorate di Benin royal palace before British soldiers loot dem for 1897 during dia military invasion. Today, thousands of dem still dey inside big museums across Europe and North America like di British Museum, Berlin Humboldt Forum, and di Metropolitan Museum of Art. Di mata about dia return don turn one of di biggest global debates for di art world. Around 150 bronzes don return home, and more still go come back. Wen dem first announce plans for di museum for Benin City in 2019, pipo for Nigeria art world bin hope say e go be di perfect home to display di returned bronzes- one modern cultural complex wey go showcase West African heritage to di world. But confusion start two years ago wen di federal govment tok say di Oba of Benin na di rightful owner and custodian of any returned bronzes and di royal palace begin push make di museum dey under dia direct control, sometin wey former Govnor Obaseki no gree for. Wia dis foto come from, AFP/Getty Images Dis one leave Mowaa for one kind delicate position: dem wan show clear stand about returning artefacts, but still dey try maintain peace wen e reach who go own am and dat na wetin make dem comot \"Edo\" from di museum name. Mr Ihenacho tok say, \"One of di tins wey don always dey worry me be say from day one, we don tok say we go focus on di modern and contemporary art. \"But sake of how di West dey always tok about di return of di Benin Bronzes, everybody dey see us like na di museum wey go collect am. Di wahala be say, we no be di owners, and we no get any legal right over di bronzes.\" Im goal na to build one place wey go support modern African creativity including film, photography, music, dance, and fashion no be only art for wall. \"Yes, we go still look back to history, but di main purpose na to inspire wetin dey hapun today\" e tok E add say, \"We don turn into museum wey dey create one full system wey go help creatives across West Africa.\" From one young Nigerian artist wey move come from di US come work as conservator, to fresh graduates wey dey do dia national youth service, to one Ghanaian PhD student wey dey do research for Mowaa, di place don already turn into a place of regional collaboration. Eweka Success, 23-year-old sculpture graduate from University of Benin, wey don tour di place, say e happy for di opportunity. E tok say plenty pipo for dis city no too care about di restitution tok, but di museum still get value. \"Many of us never even see di original bronzes before, but for here we fit study di design, di technique, and di history well.\" Cultural expert Oluwatoyin Sogbesan agree say di tok about restitution don turn something wey only elites dey follow. She tok say, \"ordinary pipo dey worry about how to survive, go work, and feed family. Plenty no even sabi wetin be bronzes.\" For her, restitution suppose go beyond just returning artefacts — e suppose also bring back memory and language. She explain say, \"We need to decolonise di word 'Benin Bronzes' imsef. Make we call dem by dia original Edo name – 'Emwin Arre' (wey mean 'Cultural Tins') - na so di pipo wey make am for Benin go call am.\" Dis idea fit well wit di museum first exhibition wey dem plan to open to di public - Homecoming. Wia dis foto come from, AFP/Getty Images E feature works from big artists like Yinka Shonibare, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Precious Okoyomon, and Tunji Adeniyi-Jones - many of dem dey live for abroad and no dey show dia works for Nigeria often. Shonibare own work, Monument to the Restitution of the Mind and Soul, get special position for di exhibition e be pyramid-shaped structure wey get more dan 150 clay replicas of di Benin Bronzes. E tok say e choose clay on purpose, as sign of connection to di Benin land imsef. \"In today world, e be like say we don dey far from nature, but our ancestors get strong bond and respect for am,\" e tok. Di pyramid remind pipo of Africa ancient wonders, while di replicas represent absence and memory. Shonibare explain say \"di work na conceptual tok about di meaning of absence and di spiritual importance of di bronzes. In one way, di work be like healing process almost like mourning.\" Anoda artwork wey catch plenty attention na Ndidi Dike 2016 mixed-media piece wey she call National Grid. Di work talk about power both electric and political. For Nigeria, light dey go off well-well and pipo don almost accept am as normal part of life. Dike use dis same idea as metaphor to question how bad govnance and poor infrastructure don affect di kontri. Dis message go surely touch di pipo wey dey work for Mowaa, especially dis week. But dem fit still hold small hope for wetin di culture minister, Hannatu Musawa, tok as she lead di presidential committee wey wan settle di matter: \"Cultural institutions na di pillars of our national identity and dem must dey protected through joint efforts wey go respect both traditional ownership and modern structures.,\" Hannatu Musawa tok. Even though some pipo fear say di wahala fit spoil efforts to bring Africa stolen art back home especially as Western museums dey use di issue of conservation as excuse, di team for Mowaa still dey strong. Dem believe say dia creativity fit redefine wetin a modern African museum suppose be weda dem get di old artefacts or not.",

Dis recent about turn dey come afta House Democats just dey do small drip feeding of di documents, some wey call Trump wey don always deny any kain link to Epstein sex abuse and trafficking.

Supporters for di bill dey appear to get enof votes for am to pass di House dis week, even though e no clear weda e go pass for Senate, di oda chamber of di US Congress. Dem bin find Epstein dead for im New York prison cell for 2019, for wetin one corona later call suicide.

Hours afta di emails comot, House Republicans bin publish 20,000 files to counter wetin dem say na Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents to try \"create fake narrative to slander\" Trump.

      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg One year afta federal prosecutors reveal sweeping criminal case against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and months afta trials wey reveal shocking details of violence and im private life, di convicted music mogul go know im fate on Friday 3 October. E fit face up to two decades behind bars, but im attorneys dey battle for more lenient sentence wey fit see how dem go free Diddy in few weeks – or acquit am. For July, jury acquit am of di most severe charges: racketeering and sex trafficking. But dem find am guilty of two counts of transportation to engage for prostitution. Each count carry maximum sentence of 10 years for prison. Prosecutors don ask for minimum of 11 years, but Diddy lawyers don argue say such sentence go dey too dramatic to reach. \"For plain terms, prosecutors wan see say dem define Diddy by di worst-case math, while di defence want make di judge cut through am and impose somtin wey dey far lighter,\" according to Todd Spodek wey be New York attorney wey once represent fake heiress Anna Sorokin. Federal judges don ultimately decide on final punishment and dem don get flexibility within guidelines - so di defence and prosecution go spend much of Friday to argue for court ova Diddy sentence. \"Na like to bargain for anytin,\" Mr Spodek tok. \"E get benchmark, e get di number for di middle, and e go up and go down.\" Probation office wey dey oversee offenders during and afta incarceration, bin separately recommend five to seven years for prison, according to wetin dey Diddy court filings. But \"ultimately, na di judge go decide,\" Mr Spodek tok. One major question wey dey loom ova di sentencing na how much Combs conduct towards di victims go factor into New York federal judge Arun Subramanian thinking. While Diddy go chop sentence on two prostitution charges, prosecutors don remind di judge of im past behaviour, wey come out during testimony and include violence, domestic abuse, and illegal drug use. Dem argue say Diddy dey \"unrepentant\". \"Di defendant try to put decade of abuse as simply di function of mutually toxic relationships,\" prosecutors write for 29 September filing. \"But notin dey mutual about relationship wia one pesin get to hold all di power and di oda end up wit blood and bruise.\" Im most high-profile victim, Cassandra Ventura, bin submit letter to di judge ahead of sentencing wia she ask for justice and accountability. She say she bin move her family away from New York City sake of retaliation. \"As much progress as I don make to recova from im abuse, I remain veri much afraid of wetin e dey capable of and di malice e dey keep towards me sake of say I dey brave to tell di truth,\" Ms Ventura write. Diddy team, however don portray am as reformed man wey suppose receive  sentence wey no pass more dan 14 months for prison. Im time for jail while di case play out go count towards dat total, e mean say if di judge agree, Diddy go soon walk free. For longer sentence, Sean Combs lawyers argue say e go unfairly keep am from im seven children and elderly mother, and prevent am from receiving mental health care. For court filings, lawyers describe Sean Combs incarceration as \"life changing, productive, and testament to im desire to return to im family and community and lead di best life possible\". Judges fit consider history, character, contributions to society, and previous criminal record during sentencing. Sean Combs lawyers give examples of im business and di music success as evidence of im contributions. Im team also submit testimonials from family members, and oda detainees for jail wia dem put Diddy. If Sean Combs receive unfavourable sentence, im legal team fit appeal di judge decision to higher court. Sean Combs lawyers dey make additional bid to free am for di sentencing hearing: as dem dey challenge di use of di anti-prostitution law wey form di basis for di charges and conviction. Last week, Diddy lawyers ask di judge to consider acquittal or new trial, citing objections ova di Mann Act. Di 1910 law get controversial history. E originally come as anti-interstate sex law wey include one sweeping immorality clause; for practice, e fit dey applied broadly, to cova interracial marriage and affairs. For di 1980s, Congress bin modernise am, and di law now form foundation for federal prostitution and sex trafficking cases. Most recently, prosecutors use am for cases against singer R Kelly, and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Diddy lawyers argue say dem no suppose bring Mann Act-related charges becos di sexual encounter wey Diddy bin engage in dey consensual, and dem believe say im conduct no amount to \"prostitution\". Mann Act charge na \" easier case to make for court of law dan trafficking conviction, wey require more elements,\" according to Jessica Pliley, wey be historian for di University of Texas and Mann Act sabi pesin. Prosecutors, like di ones wey dey handle di Combs case, dey put dem togeda. \"No be uncommon law,\" Professor Pliley tok. But prosecutors don remind di judge of accounts from Ms Ventura and one woman wey dem refer to as Jane Doe. For filings, dem recall di women testimony about how dem participate for lengthy \"freak-off\" sessions wit Diddy and male escorts wey e request, even wen e be like say dem force dem and suffer physically from di lengthy encounters. \"Defendants wey perpetrate violations of di Mann Act, wey dey involved for such violence fit face regular significant penalties,\" prosecutors write for di sentencing memo. \"Di defendant no go be exception—particularly wen im history and characteristics demonstrate years of abuse and violence.\"",

School authorities get one rule wey go force you to cut off di hair, otherwise you no go dey admitted for di school. Dat na di dilemma of many young African girls, as high schools still dey use colonial rule to force girls to shave off dia hair, in dis day and age. For Ghana, viral video of one student of di Yaa Asantewaa Girls High school for Kumasi, wey show as dem forcibly shave her long natural hair for one barber's shop as she dey go resume high school, bin raise di top all ova again.

Even though she no gree wit di school rule to cut di hair of her daughter, she no get any choice. Wia dis foto come from, LUCIA'S GLAM GH Dis mata dey beyond just cutting di hair of girls, e mean much more to oda pipo. For some na just hair, but for odas, dis be issue about dia identity and dia true self as African girls. 36-year-old musician and actress – Joy Onyinyechukwu Adomaa Serwaa Adjeman wey her stage name be 'Adomaa' still always dey triggered if dis mata come up sake of di way dem force her to cut her own hair for 2004 wen she move to Ghana from Nigeria to attend high school wit her long hair. \"I really shock wen dem say I gatz cut my hair afta dem admit me for one Ghana high school – at dat time. I get really long hair; dat be di most obvious tin you go notice about me at di time,\" Adomaa tok BBC News pidgin. She explain say \"I dey so attached to my hair, so once di school tell me say make I cut am, di tin pain me. I survive for boarding school for three years in Nigeria wit my hair, I no ever dey distracted, I fit continue high school for there, but my parents bin move to Ghana, so dem say make I also move to join dem.\" Adomaa say she struggle \"so hard\" sake of say dis rule \"no dey make sense to me\". \"Dis no be just hair, dis be mata about di identity of young African girls, some pipo dey struggle wit identity crisis sake of dis tin, sake of hair be part of who we be as Africans,\" di award-winning actress and musician explain. She say \"di same way we dey learn how to brush our teeth, how to bath and how to check ourserf, ibi di same tin wit our hair.

Dat no be true; to maintain dis hair no go take up to 20 minutes sef.\" Oda Ghanaian celebrities and personalities also share dia experiences wen high schools rules bin force dem to cut off dia hair. Actress Lydia Forson tok say,wen dem force her to cut her hair wen she return to Ghana, di tin \"traumatize\" her. \"For years, I carry shame about sometin wey be my natural hair, meanwhile di same school allow my oda friends and students wey be black wit British passport to keep dia hair.\" Lydia Forson like Adomaa and many oda pipo say time don change, society dey progress, so school rules must change to meet di needs of di present. \"We fit allow girls to keep dia hair – we go provide styles wey dey acceptable like cornrow or braids wey fit last for weeks or dem fit allow students 'hair time' to maintain dia hair, just like dem dey sign exeat to allow dem to go to town to trim dia hair. Di school also fit allow girls keep short hair by choice, no be by force,\" Lydia Forson explain on top her social media page (X).

Oga Haruna Iddrisu tok say \"dis debate about hair and length of hair for secondary schools, we no go tolerate am today, we no go tolerate am tomorrow, so long as we dey mould di character of di students.\" E add say \"if we allow hair today, tomorrow e go be shoes, di next day e go be dress – so if any parent tink say dia child go waka enta di school environment like say she dey go beauty contest, di school no be di place for dat, we no go tolerate am.\" Wia dis foto come from, ANTHONY ASAEL via GETTY/MARIA MORATTI via GETTY Some parents and experts say dem disagree wit di education minister. One parent, wey also be lecturer Dr. Jemima Nunoo tell BBC News Pidgin say \"since dis mata dey go on, I neva see any scientific study wey link cutting girls hair to dia morality or character.\" Di mother wey say she no go gree make any school force her daughter to cut her hair, explain say \"hair be symbolic of our identity, our beauty, e dey deeper dan just cutting di hair – for black women, our hair dey part of our identity.\" \"To force pesin to cut her hair, mean say you dey ask di girl to distance hersef from her identity of who she be.\" In fact, dis rule no always be di case. Dr. Jemima Nunoo say her mother no cut her hair for high school in di 70s for Ghana. \"My mother go di same Yaa Asantewaa Girls school and during her time, dem no force her to cut her hair. Di school at dat time get guidelines to keep di hair clean and tidy and natural.\" She explain say \"during hair time, di girls braid dia own hair – my mama use thread for her own, so she learn personal grooming through dat on campus.\" \"As a teenager, my mama sabi dis tins, so when she born me, she no dey carry me go any salon. She dey braid my hair for me. Na so me too I learn am.\" Dr Jemima Nunoo go gree to cut her daughter hair when di time reach for her to go to high school? \"Wit my daughter, sake of my own beliefs, I no go allow her to cut her hair for school. If she want cut am by hersef, fine – but if I get my own way, I go make sure she go school wey no go force her to cut her hair.\" Some parents agree wit di school rules wey dey force girls to cut dia hair, like oga Ernest Addo. According to him, dis rule go allow di girls concentrate and reduce \"unnecessary competition\" among dem for school. \"Di students dey go campus to learn, make dem focus on dat, no be to dey tink about braiding dia hair. In fact, in my case, I tok to my daughters and I advise dem on why dem must cut dia hair. Dat be one way di school fit enforce discipline.\" On top social media, pipo dey divided ova di mata – whether to force girls to cut dia hair or not. But why education authorities still dey force girls to cut dia hair at dis time? When dem dey allow oda students wey no be Africans to keep dia own hair? Toktok pesin for di Ghana Education service Daniel Fenyi inside one interview wit BBC News Pidgin explain say \"for Ghana students wey dey foreign kontris, dem dey treat dem as foreign students.\" \"Normally if you be international student, dem dey fit relax some of di in-house, local principles especially if dem no dey against di rules of di kontri, so di same tin dey apply to foreign students wey dey attend our schools for here.\" Oga Daniel Fenyi say dis hair policy still dey to ensure \"uniformity and discipline of our learners.\" \"Dis uniformity no be only about hair, but school uniform, shoes, time for dinner, time for prep, time for class – all dis tins na to ensure uniformity for di class so dat teachers no go dey deal wit individual taste and choice.\" Di GES toktok pesin also respond to di group of pipo wey dey call for change of di policy at dis time. \"Today di debate be about hair, pipo dey suggest say make we allow cornrow, next time anoda group go ask why we no dey allow Brazilian hair, anoda group go ask for sometin else – at what point we go pause and say dis be di limit.\" According to oga Daniel Fenyi, \"if you relax di rule today, you go dey forced to relax am more tomorrow. In any case, wetin di parents dey recommend to us about cornrows, and braids and oda tins, all be part of regulation. Why we no go make girls feel comfortable for di current regulations instead of say we go relax di boundaries.?\" Wia dis foto come from, ISSOUF SANOGO/AFP via GETTY/GERALD ANDERSON/ANADULO AGENCY via GETTY For 2021, Ghana High Court order Achimota school to admit two Rastafarian students ( Tyrone Iras Marhguy and Oheneba Nkrabea) wey di school deny sake of his dreadlocks. Di dreadlocks be manifestation of dia religion. Dis case cause plenty debate for social media. Di court tok say di decision by di school to deny di boys admission dey against his rights. According to di high court, to deny di students admission violate dia human rights to education and religious freedom, since di school rules no be compelling reason to overshadow di constitution of di kontri. Di court also tok say di 1992 constitution of di kontri big pass school rules – so if di school go create rules, those rules gat to respect di constitution. Experts say school rules neva for violate di rights of students as e dey inside di kontris constitution. Executive director of Child Rights International, Bright Appiah say di kontri for develop wetin he dey call \"safeguarding policy to guide di way and manner school administrators dey do tins for di school system.\" \"If authorities want make students cut dia hair, dis safeguarding policy go provide wetin dem fit do and wetin dem no fit do, in order not to dey against di constitution and di children's act of Ghana,\" Bright Appiah tok BBC Pidgin. According to him, \"over di years, we dey do tins anyhow for di school system, depending on di religion and di faith of di pipo wey dey manage dis schools. You fit check and compare di Anglicans, Presbyterians, di Pentecostals, di Muslim community schools, and how dem dey administer discipline.\" \"We tink say if we allow dis kind tins, pipo fit to abuse dem sake of we no get any regulation or policy about dis mata. Some of di tins wey dey happun for our schools in di name of discipline, dey violate di rights of children, like to force a girl to cut her hair bifor she go enta high school…\" Wia dis foto come from, JOE SOHM/VISIONS OF AMERICA/via GETTY Many pipo dey tok about dis mata – some say time reach for schools to change dis colonial rules to allow African girls embrace dia own identity. For Uganda, Nigeria and oda parts of Africa, dis old hair policy wey mission schools force onto African girls, affect some of di girls till now. Dis schools allegedly introduce dis hair policy to show difference between mulattos and black girls – wey dem claim say natural hair be \"ungodly and unkempt\".

According to historical records, dis kind tin force Africans to be obedient and to submit diaserf to western norms and culture.

Now pipo dey ask – time no reach say kontris for Africa go change and allow black girls manifest dia identity and allow dem to keep dia hair in school?",

      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, NIPAH DENNIS/AFP via GETTY Elections for many parts of Africa now become do-or-die mata. Dis mean say politicians wan win power by all means, so some dey use violence and oda means like vote-rigging to stay in power for many years. But dis kain tins dey affect di democracy wey kontris for Africa say dem dey practice. For Ghana, one investigation by di kontri Inspector General of Police (IGP) Christian Tetteh Yohuno into di violence wey kill 15 pipo during di 2020 and 2024 elections reveal some tins. President John Mahama for di campaign ahead of di 2024 elections, promise say e go ensure pipo wey dey responsible for di death of pipo for di 2020 elections, go face di law. In January dis year, afta he take office, president Mahama order di IGP to investigate di mata and submit di report to his office. Afta eight months, di IGP submit di report. Security analysts and many citizens say di findings of di investigation no \"inspire confidence\". Many pipo say dem dey disappointed say afta all dis while (five years), di kontri no prosecute even one pesin for di violence and di shooting during di two elections wey kill 15 citizens, including teenagers. Di taskforce establish say eight pipo die during di 2020 elections when security pipo open fire into party supporters for some polling centres. Dem also find say 40 pipo injure afta various incidents for polling centres during and afta di voting and counting process. Di kontri interior minister Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak for one press conference to announce details of di report tok say so far dem identify 21 suspects responsible for di violence during di two elections. Wia dis foto come from, CHRIS STEIN/AFPviaGETTY Some of dis pipo be policemen and soldiers wey fire live rounds at polling centres during di elections, wey odas odas be political party supporters. \"Out of di 21 suspects, dem arrest four wey dem dey on police bail, five of dem dey remanded into prison custody wey di rest dey on di run,\" di interior minister tok. About di status of di cases – di minister tok say \"four cases dey court now, three dey under investigation, wey three odas dey di Attorney General's office for advice.\" Di interior minister say govment dey committed to ensure justice for di victims no mata how long e go take. Under di previous govment (President Nana Akufo-Addo en tenure), for four years, di police fail to prosecute anybody. Di service for four years (2020 -2024) under di former IGP Dr George Akuffo Dampare say dem still dey investigate. Di police at di time tok say dem no find di security officers wey fire dia weapons for di collation centre wey kill two pipo and injure nine odas for di Techiman South constituency for di Bono East region. Civil society groups and oda human right agencies put pressure on di police but dem no deliver justice to di victims. On 2 September 2024, di High Court for Wenchi in di Bono East region order govment to pay total of GHc270K ($25K) to six victims of di 2020 electoral violence for Techiman. Justice Frederick Nawurah wey preside ova di case tok say \"dem abuse di right to life and dignity of di victims.\" Di six pipo Suleman Elliasu, Abubakari Iddrisu, Alhassan Nasiru, Aremeyaw Alhassan, Alhassan Abdul-Rahman and Paul Asue - sue di govment to demand Ghc 25m compensation ($2.3m). Father of one 18-year-old boy wey dem kill during di violence for Techiman also join di lawsuit at dat time. Di judge rule say di security officers wey fire dia guns on di election day, abuse di rights of di victims wey he order say make dem prosecute dem. He also order say as part of di compensation, make govment pay each of di six victims GHc 25k ($2.3k) wit an additional GHc20k ($1.9k) to cover legal fees during di trial. Human rights groups and experts at dat time tok say dat compensation money be too small. Oga for di Ghana Human Rights Commission, Joseph Whittal for one interview wit BBC Pidgin bifor di 2024 elections tok say dat money be chicken change. \"I agree wit pipo wey tok say di compensation be small, sake of to pay pesin Ghc45k at di time di cedi dey depreciate, wey cost of living togeda wit amount for medication and bills dey high.\" \"But di court look at di evidence bifor dem wey dem order dat kind amount – we believe say di compensation for be more than dat,\" oga Joseph Whittal add. Afta dis court ruling in September, di state neva pay di compensation to di victims till di end of 2024 when di kontri go thru anoda election. Elliasu Sulemana wey receive bullets for his right arm on election day for di collation centre in 2020, still no fit use di hand do anytin since. Security officers for di centre fire into di crowd of party supporters dat day. \"I dey work in di timber industry, I dey carry logs from di forest wey we dey take go di cities and towns, but I no fit do dat work again sake of I no fit use my right hand again.\" He explain say afta dem fix metal inside his arm, he always dey feel pain, wey he no fit use dat hand to even chop food. Di current president John Mahama during di 2024 election campaign promise di victims say his govment go compensate dem for dia injuries and di families of those wey die go also receive compensation. But one year since president Mahama enta di presidency, dat compensation never reach di victims. \"We di victims dey on our own, nobody dey mind us, even di presidency wey promise us compensation, no deliver on dat promise. Make you pipo help us to get Justice,\" Elliasu Sulemana tok BBC Pidgin. Family of 15-year-old Samira Zakaria wey also die during di 2020 elections for di Northern region of Ghana, say dem dey disappointed. Her uncle Yakubu Zakaria say \"election be to elect leaders, no be to kill pipo. My niece Samira die when bullet hit her for di party office. She no do anytin wrong.\" Oda families still get pain for dia heart – afta wetin happun to dem during di two elections in 2020 and 2024. As part of dia recommendations, di IGP special police taskforce say govment gatz to pay compensation to all di victims – both families of those wey die and di pipo wey hurt. Dem also recommend say make di police receive orientation so say dem go stop dey use lethal force to control crowd. Di taskforce also tok say election security gatz to dey coordinated well to determine when dem fit use force to control crowd. Some pipo say because di state no punish security officers and odas wey cause di death of eight and injury to 34 pipo during di 2020 elections, di officers get liver to do di same tin wey cause death of seven more pipo for di 2024 elections. CSOs and human rights groups say dis record dey affect wetin dem describe as di democratic power of di kontri. Executive Director for di Africa Centre for Security and Counterterrorism (ACSC), Emmanuel Kotin say \"ibi shame say dem no punish anybody for five years now.\" \"Ghana get many laws – even recently we pass di anti-vigilantism law wey dey ban political parties from using vigilantes, but dem no prosecute even one pesin under dat law. We no be serious as a kontri,\" oga Emmanuel Kotin tok. He explain \"until we begin to enforce our laws, we just go dey waste taxpayers money to create dis laws for dis kontri.\" \"Di victims no get justice, ibi now dem start di process, we get long way to go.\" \"Until dem prosecute all di 21 suspects wey di IGP taskforce identify from dia investigations, di victims no go get justice,\" oga Kotin tok di state broadcaster GTV. Di security expert also say time reach for di kontri to demand accountability from security officers. \"Ibi difficult tin to prosecute our security pipo and for dis case, ibi di actions of dis security personnel wey cause di death of seven out of di 15 deaths during di two elections. Until we begin to punish dem, dis tins go continue.\" He also add his voice to di calls for compensation for di victims as well as psychological support. \"Di compensation no be only di money, di state also gatz to provide psychological support to dem as di court also dey work to bring dem justice – even though we know say di courts fit take years to deal wit dis kind mata.\" Experts also dey demand reforms for di kontris electoral processes – so say political parties go support di electoral commission when dem dey organize elections, to reduce di tension and violence. As prosecution dey delay, di families of di 15 pipo wey die and di 40 oda pipo wey suffer various injuries for di 2020 and 2024 elections go continue to suffer and tink say di state deny dem justice!",

      "output": "Germany coalition govment don agree one new military service plan wey go boost troop numbers sake of months of fight between political forces. Di new military service plan go mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out  questionnaire weda dem dey suitable to serve and, from 2027, dem go do medical screening. Di decision dey come as Berlin dey aim to create di strongest conventional army for Europe. Di oga of Germany biggest defence firm, Rheinmetall, tell BBC say im believe say dem  fit meet di target in five years. Lawmakers dey expected to vote on di plan by di end of 2025. Armin Papperger say Chancellor Friedrich Merz aim to boost di Bundeswehr dey \"realistic\" and im tell di BBC say \"clear decisions\" dey come from govment. Earlier dis year, German defence chief Gen Carsten Breuer bin warn say di Western Nato alliance bin need to prepare for possible Russian attack within four years. Mr Papperger say im bin \"no get glass ball\" about di future but agree say Germany need to dey \"ready in '29\". Wen dem bin form di coalition earlier dis year, Merz conservative CDU/CSU and di centre-left Social Democrat SPD bin agree to re-introduce military service wey go dey voluntary \"to start wit\". Di Bundeswehr currently get around 182,000 troops. Di new military service model dey aim to increase di number by 20,000 ova di next year, wey go rise to between 255,000 and 260,000 ova di next 10 years, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists. From next year, dem go send all 18-year-old men and women one questionnaire to assess dia interest and willingness to join di armed forces. E go dey mandatory for men and voluntary for women. From July 2027, all men wey dey 18 go also do medical exam to assess dia fitness for duty. If di govment no meet dia target, dem go try one form of compulsory enlistment wey parliament fit consider. If war wan hapun now, di military go fit look di questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits. Some wey dey within Germany political left still no support di mandatory service at all. Small fear dey say many young Germans no too feel am and a significant majority no support am. One recent Forsa survey for Stern magazine bin suggest say while just ova half of respondents favour di compulsory service, opposition bin rise to 63% among 18- to 29-year-olds. \"I no wan go war becos I no want to die or I no want make dem shoot me\" Na wetin Jimi, wey be 17-years old student from Berlin, wey bin attend one anti-conscription protest outside di Bundestag earlier dis week tok. \"I no wan shoot pipo.\" Attack against Germany na \"unlikely and abstract scenario\" wey di govment bin use to legalise \"stealing millions of young pipo right to decide wetin dem wan do\", im tok. Meanwhile, 21-year-old Jason bin sign up as new Bundeswehr recruit early dis year becos of di current \"security situation\". \"I bin wan contribute to defend peace, to defend democracy if di worst hapun,\" im tok. As im join, e say im bin feel like \"giving back to society\" but also believe in di army, \"so potential enemies no dey even tink about attacking you\". Defence Minister Boris Pistorius bin want to reassure Germans, say despite di new military service plan no \" cause for concern... no reason for fear\". \"Di more capable of deterrence and defence our armed forces dey, through armament through training and through personnel, di less likely say e go be say we go become a party to di conflict at all,\" Pistorius tok. Defence spending for Germany tumble afta di end of di Cold War, while dem bin suspend compulsory recruitment for 2011. Sake of dia past, Germany no dey too show dia military might since, but early dis year, Friedrich Merz bin announce say di rule for German defence \"now go be whatever it takes\", sake of Russia full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nato kontris across Europe don come under pressure from President Donald Trump White House to hike spending. Di move wey Europe dey make to re-arm don mean significant revenue for Rheinmetall. Di CEO, Armin Papperger, wey im company dey also supply Ukraine, say: \"We dey make plenti money becos di demand big well-well.\" \"We need to grow strong on vehicles, on ammunition, we need to get our own satellite competencies. We dey do much more on di electronics and artificial intelligence... dan ever bifor,\" im tok. One US report last year bin suggest say di Rheinmetall boss na di target of one Russian assassination plot. Confirmation bin no dey dat time and Mr Papperger no gree tok on di report, but im say: \"I feel good, I feel safe.\" On weda im feel say Europe bin dey in a state of a cold or hybrid war, im say: \"Anytin wey you call am, no be peaceful time.\"",

      "input": "Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl na triumphant pop victory lap",
      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, TAS Rights Management Di last time we meet Taylor Swift, she bin dey ball. Her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, na emotional song – one ogbonge postmortem of two bitter, messy break-ups. We bin see her for her lowest, \"she bin dey cry for gym\" and \"dey vex\" say she waste her youth on top one six-year relationship wit British actor Joe Alwyn, wey later end as she chop breakfast. Eighteen months later, she don come back wit di latest update from her bureau; and di story dey veri different. Di songs wey she record for stolen moments during di record-shattering Eras tour, don see di 35-year-old happy, energised and newly in love wit American Footballer Travis Kelce. \"Dis album dey about wetin dey happun behind di scenes for my inner life during dis tour, wey dey so energetic and electric and vibrant,\" she tok as she appear on Kelce New Heights podcast last month. Wia dis foto come from, Max Martin / Instagram To capture dat dynamic, she produce di album no be wit her longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff – wey im productions define di sounds of Midnights, and Tortured Poets Department – but wit Swedish pop masterminds Max Martin and Shellback, wey don work wit Swift bifor on hits like Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble. Di goal, Swift tok na to make a tight, compact album of \"bangers\" wit \"melodies wey dey so infectious wey go make you almost dey vex for am\". But dis rant don do. Dis The Life of a Showgirl na rhinestone-studded success, or a chorus line catastrophe? Getting straight to di point: It's a triumph. To get straight to di point: na victory. Na combination of compelling songwriting and whip-smart production easily clear di high bar wey Swift don set for hersef. Fans wey dey expect a return to di maximalist pop of Red and 1989 go dey surprised. Swift new music dey more cool and collected pass her previous collaborations wit Martin; e tap into di atmospheric textures of im recent hits for The Weeknd and Ariana Grande. At 41 minutes, The Life of a Showgirl na di shortest album Swift don release since her debut for 2006. Wia dis foto come from, TAS Rights Management Thematically, Swift latest lyrics get two distinct threads. Half of di album 12 songs na about falling completely, goofily, head ova heels in love. Di rest tackle di seedy underbelly of fame. Along di way, we get some classics, like di image of one burlesque dancer \"wey dey glow like di end of cigar\"; she compare one critic yarn to \"a toy chihuahua wey dey bark from a tiny purse\". Anoda entire song dey wey dey filled witvplayground innuendo. Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images Fans bin expect say The Fate of Ophelia go be like Swift Shakespeare story of one noblewoman wey drown in a fit of mania afta grief make her mad. Instead, she sing about how Kelce save her from dat fate, for one crisp pop track wey dey packed wit cute references to dia relationship – wey include di Kansas City Chiefs, and di number 100 (di total of Kelce jersey number, 87, and Swift lucky number 13). \"I hear you dey call me on di megaphone,\" she tok, as she confam how dia romance start wen Kelce publicly declare im affection on im podcast for July 2023. \"If you no eva come for me, I for don drown for sadness.\" Musically, di song play clever trick as e add one extra bar for di end of evri oda phrase, as though Swift dey linger in di moment, too swept up for her feelings to continue. She pepper di album wit little flourishes like dat - and e dey supremely satisfying. Wia dis foto come from, TAS Rights Management Di lovestruck theme bin continue on Opalite, wey im breezy chords and Abba-esque harmonies unfurl like a blossoming romance; and Wi$h Li$t, wia Swift remove herself from di Hollywood pack for a life of domestic bliss. \"Dem want dat critical smash Palme d'Or and Oscar on dia bathroom floor,\" she observe. \"I just want you\". (Plus \"a couple of kids\" wit \"a best friend wey I tink say dey hot\"). But perhaps di most eye-opening tribute to Kelce na Wood - one staccato dance track, wey complete wit a Jackson 5 guitar riff. For dia, we see Swift superstitiously \"knocking on wood\", say dia relationship go last, and knocking wood for di bedroom, for one unexpected homage to her fiancé \"manhood\". E dey so silly and unexpected and e make me laugh out loud. Di same tin go for Actually Romantic, one fantastically sarcastic track about one fellow pop star (unnamed), wey call Swift \"boring Barbie\" and write songs about how much dem hate her. Ova grungy guitars and slapping drum beat, Taylor taunt dem wit a touch of reverse psychology. \"E bin sound nasty but e feel like you dey flirt wit me,\" she trill. \"All di effort you don put inside, actually dey romantic.\" She continue to settle scores on Father Figure - di scathing story of one backstabbing protégé, wey interpolate di George Michael classic of di same name. Fans go try hard to uncover di subject identity, but, to me, di song be more like a morality tale about music industry Svengali, wey possess di power to wipe out anyone wey no dey \"loyal to di family\". Full of cinematic strings and disorientating key changes, e sit alongside No Body, No Crime, Bad Blood and Vigilante S*** for Swift expanding catalogue of revenge anthems. Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images Di album best track, however, na di soft-focus ballad Ruin The Friendship. Time-travelling to Swift high school days for Tennessee, recollect di tori about one boy wey she put for friend zone as she dey long for a single kiss. Delicate and nostalgic, e take a heart-wrenching turn for di third verse, wen Swift real life best friend Abigail call to say dia former schoolfriend don die, and she fly through di night to attend di funeral. For inside album wey largely centre on contentment, di regret and sadness hit double hard. Di collection end wit di title track, one spirited duet wit Sabrina Carpenter wey double as a cautionary tale about stardom. Na di only song wey really lean into di showgirl concept, wit a percussive tap-dancing interlude and ostentatious key changes, as di stars trade lines about dia cut-throat industry. \"All di headshots on the walls of di dance hall / Are of the bitches who wish I'd hurry up and die,\" Swift sing. Den di punchline: \"But I'm immortal now, baby doll.\" E feel like a deliberate call-back to Look What You Made Me Do, wey she write for 2017 afta one public showdown wit Kanye West and afta months of negative press. Back den, she sing: \"The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now… Why? Oh, cause she's dead.\" For 2025, wit di world at her feet, Swift fit finally tok wit certainty say her place for pop history dey guaranteed. The Life of a Showgirl na her well-earned victory lap.",

      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, AFP/Getty For Bamako, Mali capital city, di normal sound of car engine and horn don turn to sound of pipo wey dey waka for road. Residents dey push dia motorbike wey fuel don finish for inside through di dusty road, dem dey vex becos di fuel blockade don paralyze Mali for more dan two months. Di jihadist group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), wey dey linked wit al-Qaeda, dey attack fuel tankers wey dey bring petrol enter Mali. Dem don kidnap drivers and burn more dan 100 trucks wey dey come Bamako. Life don hard for plenty Mali pipo, school and university don close, food price don rise, and hospital dey struggle wit light wahala. Di fuel shortage don even make foreign kontris worry. US don tell Americans make dem no travel go Mali, and France don advise im citizens make dem comot from di kontri quick. One picture wey show how serious di mata be na di long fuel queue wey dey outside almost every petrol station. \"We dey here dey wait for fuel, and we don dey here for more dan four days now,\" na wetin Sidi Djiré, one taxi driver wey dey wait for petrol station for Bamako, tell BBC. Mr Djiré tok say e dey hope say Mali military govment go solve di wahala quick, bicos \"whether you be trader or teacher, everybody work don suffer.\" For some petrol station inside Bamako, motorists dey meet one small paper wey get just three frustrating words \"no fuel today.\" Plenty delivery and bus drivers don begin sleep for filling station, just to be among di first pipo to buy fuel wen e finally land. As transport fare don triple for some part of Bamako, some passengers don abandon bus completely, dem dey trek long distance go work. For Baco Djicoroni market, one customer, Assitan Diarra, tok say food price don triple. \"Life hard well well now. But wetin we fit do? We dey war. We dey pray make God bring peace and relief for our kontri,\" Ms Diarra tok. \"Di goods wey we dey get before easily no dey easy again bicos transport no dey for pipo wey dey sell food, fuel shortage don make am hard to get supply\" na wetin Amadou Traoré tok. Wetin dey hapun for Mali fuel wahala no be ordinary, e look like well-planned move. Wen di military junta take power five years ago, plenty pipo support dem bicos dem promise to solve di security crisis wey start from northern rebellion before Islamist militants like JNIM take over. But instead of peace, di Islamist wahala don worse, especially for di north and east, wey don turn areas wey govment no fit control again. Over di past year, JNIM don increase attacks, and di fuel blockade now show say dem don change strategy from small ambush to economic warfare. Mali no get sea na landlocked kontri, so dem dey depend on fuel wey dey come from Senegal and Ivory Coast. Now wey jihadists don block di roads, transport, light, and logistics don nearly stop. Hospitals dey suffer sake of diesel no dey to power generator, and e don begin affect emergency services. For Kalaban Coro Health Centre, Dr Issa Guido tell BBC say, \"our workers suppose report to duty early, but now, e hard for dem to even get fuel to come work.\" Teachers and students too no fit travel, and dat one make schools and universities close for two weeks. Even wen dem reopen, some rural teachers still no fit show up. Di kasala don affect millions of pipo for Mali, and pipo don start to dey ask questions. To reduce di tension, govment don send army trucks to escort fuel tankers from border to Bamako, but some convoys still come under attack. Reports say Mali govment don also sign emergency fuel deal wit Russia, to import refined fuel and get technical help to protect transport routes. Even though officials dey talk say evritin dey under control, critics still accuse di junta say dem no dey plan ahead, dem just dey react to every new crisis. Wia dis foto come from, AFP/Getty Images Di fuel shortage don turn double wahala for Mali govment wey Colonel Assimi Goïta dey lead. One side of di mata be say di regime fit use am show say dem be victim of jihadism, to gada national support and justify tighter security control. But di oda side be say, di fuel blockade don expose how weak di govment don become outside Bamako, and e don make pipo begin lose confidence for di same junta wey promise to end jihadist wahala. Di fuel shortage don also make Mali depend more on Russia. Since French and UN soldiers comot, Russian mercenary groups don dey support Col Goïta govment, and now, di situation fit push Mali deeper inside Moscow influence, wey fit make Western kontris withdraw aid and investment. Relations wit di US and European Union no dey strong, while France relationship don nearly cut finish. But for ordinary Mali pipo, all dis geopolitics no mean anytin wen food don cost and pipo no fit even go work. Amidou Diallo, one welder wey dey waka up and down to find fuel for im generator, tell BBC say di situation fit lead to more crime and bad security. \"We dey face crisis,\" e tok. \"If e continue like dis, oda problems fit rise and dat one fit give pipo dangerous ideas.\"",

      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images All of us tink say we sabi brush our teeth – we tink say na to brush am for morning and night, rinse our mouth wit water plus maybe one minty mouthwash for good measure. But according to dental experts, even di pesin wey sabi brush pass fit dey make small-small mistakes wey fit affect dia teeth. Dr Praveen Sharma, from di school of dentistry for di University of Birmingham, tok say half of adults go get gum disease at some point and di early sign na bleeding gums. \"If your gums dey bleed or dey swell, dat na sign say you suppose dey brush well-well,\" e tok. Apart from regular dentist visits, e say four tins dey wey many of us dey do wrong, wey if we fit change, go improve di health of our teeth. To dey brush two times a day na one of di greatest dental commandments – and na wetin NHS recommend. But Dr Sharma say di real key na quality, no be quantity. \"If you fit find time, den yes, two times a day,\" e tok. \"But e beta to brush well-well once a day, pass make you brush two times and no do am well. If you dey brush once a day, e advice say make e be for evening and make sure you also use dental floss to comot all di nyamayama and food wey hide inside teeth wey toothbrush no go fit remove. Although, nobody like to dey floss but Dr Sharma say using interdental brushes, particularly rubber ones, fit make am dey easier and less painful. Wen e come to di method, each tooth get outer, biting and inner surface and you gatz brush wit all three. Dr Sharma advise small circular motions ova each surface without applying too much pressure. E also advice pipo to pay particular attention to di junction between di tooth and gum as dat na wia gum disease dey start from. Dr Xand tok say e dey important to \"focus on di sensation of di bristles\" and approach tooth brushing mindfully. Many pipo dey brush dia teeth afta dem chop finish, but dat fit no dey right. \"Di best tin na to brush bifor breakfast,\" Dr Sharma tok. \"You no wan do am afta something acidic. \"If you brush afta you chop, den you go need leave some space between eating and brushing.\" Dat na bicos acids from foods and drinks, especially fruit juice or coffee, fit soften tooth enamel and to brush immediately afta you chop fit affect am. Dr Chris suggest rinsing your mouth wit water afta you chop finish to get clear off some acid and den wait at least 30 minutes if you wish to brush afta breakfast. If you dey always rinse and gargle your mouth afta you brush, you go need tink am again. \"You fit spit out di paste but no rinse,\" Dr Sharma advise. Rinsing your mouth go wash away di concentrated fluoride for di remaining toothpaste. E simply mean spitting out di excess toothpaste and leaving di thin layer of fluoride behind to continue protecting your teeth. Dr Sharma, say e no really mata which brand you choose, as long as e contain one key ingredient. \"As long as your toothpaste get fluoride, e no make much difference,\" e tok, e add say im dey like buy di one wey dey cheaper or di one wey dey free. Fluoride dey help protect di enamel and prevent decay, and dat na wetin really count. However, your dentist fit recommend specific toothpastes to use if you suffer from issues like sensitive gums. Dr Sharma say you need to find time to brush properly. \"You no wan to dey brush your teeth or clean your teeth while you dey do oda tins,\" e tok. Ideally, you go need to dey stand in front of your mirror and focus properly. Many right-handed pipo unconsciously dey brush dia left side longer, and left-handed pipo dey brush dia right side longer, wey fit lead to more inflammation on di side wey dey receive less attention. Be aware of which hand you dey use brush and consciously try to brush both sides equally and carefully.",

Di group arrive for OR Tambo International Airport but dem initially refuse dem entry and dem dey stranded for di plane for more dan 10 hours. Local authorities say di group \"no get di customary departure stamps for dia passports.\" Dem eventually allow most of dem into di kontri afta intervention from a local charity and becos di govment \"empathy [and] compassion\", Ramaphosa say. Di circumstances wey surround dia departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa still remain unclear. South Africa don maintain strong support for di Palestinian throughout di war between Hamas and Israel for Gaza. Ramaphosa say di group \"somehow mysteriously dey inside plane wey pass by Nairobi\" and fly to South Africa, according to reports by di News24 site. Israeli military body Cogat, wey dey control Gaza crossings, tok for dia statement say \"di residents comot from di Gaza Strip afta Cogat receive approval from third country to receive dem.\" E no specify di kontri. End of Di one wey oda users dey read well well According to di Palestinian embassy for South Africa, di group bin comot from Israel Ramon Airport and fly to di country through di Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\". \"One unregistered and misleading organization don cheat di tragic humanitarian conditions of our pipo for Gaza, deceive families, collect money from dem, and facilitate dia travel for irregular and irresponsible manner\". Of di 153, 23 bin manage to fly on to oda destinations, wit 130 wey dem admit into di country, South African authorities say. Ramaphosa, wen e tok during one event for Johannesburg, e say di home affairs minister bin inform am of di crisis. In response, di president say \"we no fit turn dem back\", according to News24. \"Even though dem no get di necessary documents and papers, dis na pipo from a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\" Di president also tell reporters say di South African govment go carry out \"proper evaluation\" of di mata and update di public on \"wetin dey happun and how dis mata come to be wia e dey\", according to public broadcaster SABC. Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber say di while Palestinian passport-holders qualify for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, di lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses for some of di travellers documentation result in di initial refusal to let dem into di kontri. Once dem establish say di absence of dis information \"no mean say di travellers wish to apply for asylum\" and dem confam dia accommodation, dem grant dem entry. \"All of di travellers dey in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of dem have don apply for asylum,\" e say.

One of di Palestinians wey speak to local eNCA TV express im relief to dey for South Africa, e describe am as a kontri of \"peace, laws and justice\". \"We come from Gaza wia we face death on daily basis. We survive war of two years and we dey lucky to dey here,\" one man wey run wit im wife and two children say. Gift of di Givers don call for Ramaphosa to investigate di home affairs ministry and border authority for di \"humiliation wey dem cause\" di Palestinians. Di organisation founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman say dis treatment include being forced to wait for hours on di tarmac for di airport, dem deny dem food provided by di group and \"using evri excuse for di book to prevent dis passengers make dem no come down from di plane.\" South Africa dey highly critical of Israel military operation for Gaza. Di kontri sympathy for di Palestinian fight for an independent state go back decades, particularly di early 1990s wen anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledge support for di Palestinian cause. Large pro-Palestinian march don hold around South Africa since di conflict begin. Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies don hold for di kontri, wey dey host di largest Jewish community for sub-Saharan Africa. For 2023, di South African govment filed case against Israel wit di International Court of Justice, accusing dem of genocide for Gaza. Israel don strongly reject di South African claim, as e call am \"baseless\".",

      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, PA Media United Kingdom Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood don unveil wetin dem dey reason to be di biggest changes to tackle illegal migration \"for modern times\". Di package, follow di stricter approach wey di Denmark centre-left govment bring wey make refugee status temporary. UK don narrow di appeal process and threaten visa bans on countries wey block return attempt of dia nationals. Pipo wey UK grant asylum go only dey allowed to stay for di country temporarily, dem go dey review dia status every 30 months. Dis one mean say, dem go fit return pipo go dia home country if dem see say e dey \"safe\". Dis scheme na di same wit di approach for Denmark, wia refugees get two-year permit and must reapply wen e expire. Refugees go also need to be resident for UK for 20 years bifor dem go fit apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain – dis one go up from di current five years. Di govment go also create one new \"work and study\" visa route and encourage refugees to find employment or begin education in order to switch enta dis route and earn settlement more quickly. Only those wey dey dis work and study route go fit sponsor family members to join dem for UK. Di home secretary dey also plan to end di process wey dey allow multiple appeals for di cases of asylum cases and replace am wit one single, consolidated appeal wia dem must raise all grounds once. Dem go create one new independent appeals body, staffed by trained adjudicators and supported by early legal advice. To do dis, di govment go introduce one law wey go change how dem dey apply for right to family life under Article 8 of di European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for migration court cases. Only those wey get immediate relatives, like children or parents, go fit remain for UK for future. Dem go remove foreign offenders and pipo wey enta di country illegally. Di govment go also narrow di application of Article 3 of di ECHR, wey ban inhuman or degrading treatment. Ministers say di current interpretation of di law dey allow multiple appeals against refusals for asylum – wey include serious criminals wey don block dia deportation sake of healthcare issues. Dem go tighten di Modern Slavery Act to stop last minute trafficking claims wey dem dey use stop removals by requiring asylum seekers to disclose all relevant information early. Dem go treat any information wey dey disclosed later as less credible. Mahmood go cancel di legal duty to provide asylum seekers wit support, and dat go end guaranteed housing and weekly pay. Support go still dey available for \"those wey dey very helpless\" but dem no go support pipo wey get permission to work but no gree work, and from pipo wey break di law or disobey removal directions. Dem go also deny support for those wey \"deliberately make themselves destitute\". Asylum seekers wey get assets go dey required to contribute to di cost of dia accommodation. Dis one dey similar to Denmark approach wia asylum seekers must use dia savings to pay for dia accommodation and authorities fit seize dia assets for border. UK Home Office sources don rule out seizing sentimental items like wedding rings, but Home Office Minister Alex Norris don suggest say cars and e-bikes fit dey targeted. Di govment bin previously promise to end di use of hotels to hold asylum seekers by 2029, official figures show say e cost di govment £5.77m per day last year. Di govment also dey plan to end di current system wia families wey dem deny dia asylum claims still dey receive housing and financial support until dia youngest child turn 18. Ministers say di current system don create one kain encouragement to remain for di UK without status. Instead, dem go offer families financial assistance to return voluntarily, but if dem refuse, enforced removal go follow. Alongside tightening access to refugee status, UK go create new legal routes to di di country, wit annual cap on numbers. Under di changes, volunteers and community groups go fit sponsor individual refugees, wey be like di \"Homes for Ukraine\" scheme wia Britons bin host Ukrainians wey bin dey run from war. Govment go also expand di work of di Displaced Talent Mobility pilot, wey dem set up for 2021, to encourage businesses to sponsor at-risk pipo from around di world to come UK to help fill skills gaps. Di home secretary go set annual cap on arrivals via dis routes, based on local capacity. But those wey dey come di country on legal routes go be on a streamlined ten-year route to settlement. Di Home Secretary say UK go apply Visa penalties to countries wey fail to co-operate wit di returns policies, wey include one \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries wit high asylum claims until dem take back dia citizens wey dey for UK illegally. UK don already identify three African countries wey dem get plans to penalise if dia govments no improve co-operation on removals. Di govments of Angola, Namibia plus Democratic Republic of Congo get one month to start co-operating before dem impose sanctions, Home Office tok on Monday. Di govment dey also plan to roll out new technologies to strengthen enforcement. Trials of AI-driven technology to verify di age of asylum seekers, particularly those wey dey claim to be children. Alongside dis, di govment dey plan to introduce one digital ID by di end of Parliament. Dis go allow more accurate right-to-work checks by employers and e go make am harder for illegal workers to use fraudulent documents, di govment argue.",

Dis one bad.\" Di whole controversy center around MHD Model Management and im founder, Enoch Raimi. Many models come out anonymously through Organisation for Models in Nigeria say dem dey ask make dem pay bifor dem go fit participate for Lagos Fashion Week. Hannah Martin, wey work wit di agency for some months, also share her own tori of exploitation and threat. She tok say afta dem pick her for one mandatory casting call, she decide to commot from di agency afta Enoch Raimi begin send her abusive messages. Martin tok say Raimi don tell her bifor say she don get international placement — chance to model abroad — and even send her email to confirm am. But later dem remove her from di placement. \"E say e go bring me down and make sure I no model again\" she tell BBC. \"I dey cry… most times, you go see say dem no even ask model opinion bifor dem begin charge\" she add. When she later ask why payments delay and deductions plenty, Raimi vex and begin act hostile. For phone interview wit BBC, Enoch Raimi defend imself but accept say e make mistakes. For di designer payment matter, e tok say e just dey try secure spots for im models both off schedule and main LFW stage. \"Pipo don twist di issue like say I wan exploit public for Lagos Fashion Week. E no be so,\" e tok. E deny say e neva ask models to pay and claim say e even dey pay for dia transport and training. Raimi admit say e use wrong language sometimes \"I no suppose mix emotion wit business. I still dey grow as agency. I make mistakes, but some no go ever repeat again.\" Talking about Salami, Raimi tok say e sorry \"I really sorry say all dis happun.\" E tok say e mistakenly share screenshot of dia financial chats bicos e dey try defend imself from di pay-for-runway tok. Dis year Lagos Fashion Week casting dey \"chaotic,\" model and creative director Naomi Utere tok. She attend but dem no pick her, later one designer directly recruit her. \"Di place wey dem use for casting too small,\" Utere tok. \"We all dey sweat. Eviribodi dey push. One girl climb fence escape bicos she no wan pass middle wia crowd full.\" Anoda model, Amanda Basil, confirm di same tin \"Models no dey comfortable; odas climb fence just to go house... pipo wey enter looking fine come out looking somehow.\" Dem also complain say di all-black dress code plus cramped space make everytin worse. \"We dey risk our life, time and energy to work we suppose dey get pay, no be exploitation\" Basil add. Plenty models tell BBC say dem dey suffer poor pay, delay payment, and bad working condition. Many dey work overnight wit injuries and no get health insurance. Pay for Nigeria dey vary from small transport stipend to N300,000 ($168; £138)  for big show. LFW dey reportedly pay 100,000 to 50,000 naira  ($56–$84; £46–£69) for whole week. Meanwhile, for Paris or London, one single show fit give models thousands of dollars, while for oda African hubs like as South Africa and Kenya, high-profile bookings fit pass Nigerian model weekly income. \"Na di same show o, one person go collect just transport, anoda 100k, anoda 250k,\" Utere tok. Basil add \"Dis idea say models suppose collect small money need to stop. We be human beings wit bills to pay. Many pipo don quit sake of dis. If no be say I love am, I for don stop long time.\" Even for young models wey dey live wit family or for university hostels, wey dem pay for accommodation yearly, week fashion pay no fit covers dia basic costs. Dis gap show imbalance for Nigerian fashion industry, wia what many pipo dey consider international norms clash sharply wit local reality. Bernice Asein, wey write \"Fashion Law in Africa\" and be founder of one fashion law institute, describe di situation as part of one bigger crisis. \"We get labour law crisis,\" Asein tok to BBC about Nigeria fashion industry, but she add say e reflect di wider labour situation and economic reality for di kontri. \"Models dey react well well now bicos for years dem don dey overwork dem.\" Asein dey support say industry make dem self-regulate through code of conduct, like the New York Fashion Workers Act under state labour law, wey, for example, require say payment must show within 46 days afta job complete and make higher rates dey for extra hours — tins wey plenty models for Nigeria dey tok say never solve bicos Nigerian Labour Law no address dem. Di act still dey demand written contracts for all jobs, protection against unauthorised use of images, and safeguards to make sure fair treatment and pay transparency dey between models, agencies and brands. Asein, wey be lawyer wey represent plenty models and dey help dem through bad contracts, tok say she dey always push for dem to speak up because na important tin for change. \"I don see progress wey don happun internationally and we need to copy dat here to protect dem.\" Plenty models still dey fear to share dia experiences for public, dem dey fear say industry big pipo fit blacklist dem. Lagos Fashion Week na platform wey \"plenty pipo dey desperate to waka for\" sake say e add to dia portfolios. \"Pipo dey see am as prestige,\" one model tok, but ask make name no show. Di fear of losing opportunities make many keep quiet about exploitation. Recent online activism don bring many issues come light, including critics say some designers dey ask for volunteer models and one documentary wey show discrimination and exploitation. Even though dem drop her from Lagos Fashion Week, Salami still determined to show her collection alone, although she fear di extra cost as small brand. \"Too many pipo depend on me for dia income... since I show up here, my reality don bicom to provide income for pipo; dat one never disappear,\" she tok. \"Dis collection come from deep place. E go pain me if nobodi see am.\" Lagos Fashion Week organisers dem bin contact for comment but dem no reply BBC requests.",

Di fans also dey bash di players say dem no dey show enough commitment and passion wenever dem wear di Ghana jersey. For di away game against Chad wey be di whipping boys for di group, Ghana drop points - fans and critics blast di team say dem complicate tins for di qualification. Wit di upcoming games, coach Otto Addo invite di regular top players wey dey shine for dia clubs, but fans still dey worry wen dis players go deliver some of di performance dem dey show for dia clubs. But for Blackstars Jersey, Semenyo score only three goals wit one assist from 27 games. Ghana coach Otto Addo afta di 1-0 win vs Mali in di last qualifier explain why Semenyo dey struggle wit di Blackstars. \"E bi difficult to compare games from Ghana and Africa wit premier league games. All di games get dia own nature, dem be different.\" \"Semenyo dey shine for premier league but for me even though he no score in dat Mali game, e play well,\" coach Otto Addo tok. So far di 25-year-old get one goal and four assists dis season. Former England striker Wayne Rooney tok for BBC Match of di day show say \"Kudus be breath of fresh air, wey e go impact Tottenham dis season.\" Kudus score two goals to draw 2-2 against Egypt for di 2023 Afcon for Ivory Coast.

For many football fans, di reason be poor coaching. Football fan Robert Kuegbesika say \"di tactics of di coach no dey allow players to explore.\" \"Antoine Semenyo be dat guy.

We change di names of victims and omit identifying details also to protect dia privacy and safety. Enat bin dey house with her eight-year-old niece wen di soldiers come one Sunday morning, she tok. Di Ethiopian army bin dey search homes for di Amhara region on 5 January dis year, as part of a crackdown on a growing rebellion wey dey launched by local militias known as Fano. Enat say three men, wey wear army uniform, enter her home for South Gondar and begin ask questions about her family background and weda Fano fighters bin don visit di beer hall wia she work. \"How we go lie? How we go hide di truth?\" Enat tok, Fano - Amharic word wey translate somehow to volunteer fighters - dey made up of locals. After dem ask questions about her family background, Enat say di soldiers begin insult her, den threaten her niece wit gun wen di little girl start to cry. Enat say one of di soldiers come rape her in front of her niece while di odas keep guard. \"I beg dem not to hurt me. I call on di saints and beg dem. But dia hearts no pity me. Dem violate me.\" Enat, wey come from di Amhara ethnic group, di second largest in Ethiopia, dey among thousands of women believed to don dey sexually assaulted and raped since di conflict between di Ethiopian army and Fano start for August 2023. Sexual violence for di region dey largely undocumented, but BBC don collate data wey show thousands of reports of rape between July 2023 and May 2025, wit victims as young as eight and as old as 65. While restrictions don prevent independent media from entering Amhara to cover di conflict, BBC team for Nairobi, for neighbouring Kenya, manage speak to women and doctors for di region, and dem give rare insight into di human impact of di crisis. Di conflict begin wen di govment attempt to disband regional military groups, including di ones for Amhara, wey fight with di army during di 2020-2022 civil war for di next-door region of Tigray. Fano militias bin feel betrayed by di move and believe say e go leave dem vulnerable to attack from Tigray and elsewis, especially as violence against di Amhara community don intensify, according to rights groups. In response, Fano launch rebellion, and seize major towns. Dem claim say dem dey fight for regional autonomy and to protect dia communities from marginalisation by di Ethiopian govment. Di insurgency don result to violent crackdown by di army, wey dey call Fano \"radical ethno-nationalists\". Wia dis foto come from, Klawe Rzeczy Since di conflict start, both sides dey accused of plenti human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced displacement, destruction of property, looting and widespread cases of sexual violence, including rape. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, say e get evidence say di army dey somehow responsible for di abuses. Dem also say Amhara pipo for oda parts of Ethiopia dey deliberately targeted by di security forces and oda armed groups. Bifor di attack, Enat bin never have sex and bin plan to one day marry for her local church for ceremony wey dey conducted in accordance wit di Ethiopian Orthodox Church rites, just as oda women for her family don do. Such marriages dey among di most revered traditions of di Amhara pipo, wey mostly be Orthodox Christian, but e require say couples go remain \"pure\" and no get any sexual contact until marriage. \"Bifor dat day, I never know man,\" she tok. Tigist, 18, from West Gojjam, also for di Amhara region, bin dey work for her family small, traditional teahouse bifor di attack. She describe how, for January 2024, one soldier wey be regular customer grope her. She say she reject am - act she believe say lead to di attack. Later dat evening, as she dey return home from work, she say three soldiers, including di man wey grope her, ambush her for street and gang-rape her for di pavement. \"My family find me unconscious for di roadside,\" she recall. \"Na dem carry me go clinic, wia I spend five days.\" Since di attack, Tigist say she no fit leave her house, as she dey paralysed by fear of men and di outside world. \"My fear dey keep me from going to work... weneva I see soldiers or any men I go panic and hide myself away.\" She end up retreating from her life and breaking off her engagement. She say she never tell her fiance why or wetin hapun. Overwhelmed wit despair, Tigist bin attempt to take her own life, but her family intervene just in time and save her. She say although she don contemplate am since dem, she promise her family say she no go try to kill herself again. For dis facilities, dem get 2,697 reports of rape between 18 July 2023 and May 2025. Children under 18 account for 45% of cases. Just over half of di victims test positive for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), while many also get belle, with severe psychological trauma. However, many victims of sexual violence never report di crime or seek treatment, as dem dey fear stigma or to learn say dem don get STI or become pregnant. For dis reason, one senior health expert, wey tok to BBC on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, say di victims wey come facilities for di Amhara region na only \"di tip of di iceberg\". Lemlem dey among those wey never report dia rape or seek medical treatment, as she dey fear to hear say she fit get a sexually transmitted infection, such as HIV. Di 23-year-old from South Gondar say na govment soldier wey enter her house on 6 January to ask for information, one routine army practice rape her. She say wen she no give dem wetin dem want, one of di soldiers rape her. \"E threaten me, say: 'If you scream, one bullet dey enof for you,'\" Lemlem tok. \"I cry non-stop for a whole month. I no fit eat. All I do na to dey cry. I no fit stand up waka sef. And I come sick.\" She say di assault don drive her comot from church, wia she fear say she fit be di subject of gossip. \"E dey horrible to dey born as a woman. Had it bin I be man, dem for beat me and waka comot - dem for no destroy my life like dis,\" Lemlem tok as she explain how di trauma of di attack don make her feel about being female. Wia dis foto come from, Klawe Rzeczy \"Wen dem come, dem bin dey shake badly, too intimidated even to tok,\" one medic tok. Yet those wey even come forward dey reluctant to name dia attackers and rarely seek justice, in part becos di conflict don lead to a breakdown in law and order.  Instead, most of di ones wey come seek medical assistance dey come out of fear of pregnancy. Odas seek treatment long after dem bin dey attacked, by dat point, certain medications for di STIs dem don get, such as HIV, no longer dey effective. HIV often dey prevented with a treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis, but only if e dey administered soon after sex with someone wey dey infected. Anoda medic say many victims say dem no fit access treatment promptly due to transport disruption and road blockages caused by di conflict. One senior medic warn say dem dey fear say public health and social crisis fit dey front dey come. Based on information health centres don gada, dem say dem don \"identify signs say HIV infections fit rise and mental health and psychological problems fit reach catastrophic levels\", noting say some victims don attempt suicide. Figures from Ethiopia health ministry for 2022 show say di HIV rate for di region dey around 1.1 per 100 pipo - higher dan di national average. While assaults dey carried out by both sides for di conflict, medical staff report say dem see more cases wey involve Ethiopian army soldiers dan Fano militia. One govment employee with access to relevant information, wey agree to tok on condition of anonymity, also say dis na di case. Most incidents of rape dey reported in urban areas wia di army dey maintain base and get control, however, experts point out say pipo wey dey live for cities get beta access to treatment so dem dey more likely to get help and report attacks. For June 2024, di UN Office of di High Commissioner for Human Rights report say di Ethiopian National Defence Force, wey include di army, bin commit sexual violence, including against minors, for di Amhara region during di conflict with Fano militia. One Fano leader, Asres Mare Damtie, tell BBC say di group no dey aware of any involvement by dia fighters, say no accusations dey against dem and dem dey enforce severe punishment, including death, for offenders. For 2021, wen di army and dia allies - wey dat time bin include Fano - face similar allegations over dia conduct for di Tigray conflict, di govment bin condemn di use of rape but dismiss di claims as \"biased and flawed\". To date, dem never take or publicly disclose any official action against perpetrators. Amnesty International don raise concerns over wetin dem believe to be a continuous pattern of impunity for Ethiopia army. \"Dia is no meaningful effort to bring perpetrators into justice,\" na so di organisation regional researcher, Haimanot Ashenafi tok. \"Dem still dey fight, dem still dey out dia with no consequences for wetin dem don do… survivors wey don go through dis kain life-changing experience deserve justice.\" For Enat, di consequences of her attack dey far-reaching. One month after di assault, she run comot from her village to escape di trauma of di attack. Na dia she learn say she dey pregnant as a result of di rape. \"I start to vomit,\" she recall. She bin tink of abortion, wey dey legally permitted for Ethiopia up to 12 weeks into pregnancy if dem rape di woman, but she dey scared. \"I fear God, and I feel for my mother. Wetin go become of her if I die during di abortion?\" She give birth to her daughter for early September after three days of labour. Despite wetin hapun to her, Enat consider di baby a \"gift from God\". But she currently dey live with one relative and dey unable to work as she get to look after her daughter. She dey worry for di future and how she go provide for her child and herself. \"If dis na wetin e be to dey considered to be living, den yes, I dey live ,\" she add.",

      "output": "Wia dis foto come from, Thanasis/Getty Images Di writing of many healthcare professionals dey hard to understand sotay dem don even push plenti Brazilian states to pass law wey go require doctors to type prescriptions for computer or, at least, write am make e dey clear wit no abbreviations. But wetin explain di shape of our handwriting? And why some pipo get a perfect handwriting, while odas own be like say dem no fit write wetin pesin fit read at all? Anthropologist Monika Saini, professor for di Department of Social Sciences for India National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, tok say handwriting require coordination between di eyes and motor skills. \"I go tok say handwriting na one of di most complex skills wey human beings don develop\" she tell di BBC World Service CrowdScience programme. Saini main academic interest na to understand di factors wey make each of us unique for our handwriting. Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images \"Writing depend on utensils and our hands. And wen we tink of hands, we dey tok about somtin wey dey veri delicate, made up of 27 bones, wey dey controlled by more dan 40 muscles, most of dem dey for di arm and dey connected to di fingers by a complex network of tendons\", she explain. Dis mean say our handwriting dey partly influenced by our anatomy and di genetic characteristics we inherit from our parents. In oda words: your height, di way you sidon, di angle of your notebook or paper, di firmness of your hand, weda you dey right- or left-handed... All dis dey influence di shape of di letters and words we dey produce. But small cultural influence dey wey dem no fit ignored. Abi na for house, for early childhood, wey we dey learn to hold pencil or pen, wit di help of our elders. Di way dem use dis utensils, dem dey pass am on wen di pikin take im first strokes wit pencil. Den school kon join - and a new wave of influence from teachers and classmates enta di mata. As di years go by, our writing go kontinu to change. One of di reason na becos, afta years of training and learning, many of us start to write less on a daily basis. And lack of habit, combined wit di rush of evriday life, fit make us less attentive to di way we write letters, syllables, words, sentences, paragraphs... We no fit also ignore di role of new technologies, wey dey make us type more dan we write wit hand. Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images As part of one of her research projects, Ms Saini bin wan get beta understanding of di most important factors for pesin handwriting. To do am, she prepare a simple text on climate change and ask a group of volunteers to copy di sentences and make dem use di writing style wey dem sabi well-well. Afta dem collect di papers, di anthropologist fit assess elements like di size of di letters, shape of each symbol, di space between words or di pesin ability to follow straight lines in paragraphs. Using image recognition programmes, e dey possible to compare di writing wit di model wey i tok about bifor \" di researcher explain. Wen a parent teach dia pikin to write, e dey highly likely say we go find similarities between di two scripts. But pesin handwriting dey also influenced by di time dem bin spend for school or by di style of a particular teacher.\" Neuroscientist Marieke Longcamp, from di University of Aix-Marseille for France, dey studying how we take sabi how to write. To do am, she use magnetic resonance imaging machines, wey dey allow pesin brain to be view in real time as dem dey perform certain activities. For one of di study, dem give di volunteers tablet (writing material) wey fit record dia writing movements while dem dey examine dem. Ms Longcamp report say e dey possible to observe di activation of different parts of di brain, wey dey work togeda to make di complex act of writing possible. Regions like di premotor cortex, primary motor cortex and parietal cortex dey involved for di planning and control of hand gestures,\" she tells CrowdScience. Structures wey dey for di base of di brain, like di frontal gyrus, wey dey involved in certain aspects of language, and di fusiform gyrus, wey dey process written language dey influence writing.\" 'Anoda fundamental structure na di cerebellum, wey dey coordinate movements and corrects our gestures', Marieke Longcamp add. Di neuroscientist point out say writing depend essentially on two senses: vision and proprioception. \"Proprioception dey takes into account information from di muscles, di skin and di whole body. All dis dey encoded wen we write\", she explain. Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images For dis context, e dey curious to see how di development of technology fit influence di way we understand information. For many centuries, good old-fashioned writing na di only way to take notes, study, memorise and learn different tins. But dis don change radically in recent years wit di arrival of computers, tablets and smartphones. Today, many young pipo dey learning to write wit keys and screens, instead of pencil, pen and paper. Dis transition get any impact on learning? Professor of psychology and neuroscience Karin Harman James, from Indiana University for di United States, dey seek to answer dis question. She dey study how our hands, and di way we hold and manipulate objects, influence brain development and di way we learn. According to dis specialist, difference  dey in terms of brain function between to look a letter or words and to uss di body motor systems to interact wit dis pieces of written information. 'I bin want to understand how di interaction of objects wit our hands dey enable us to activate di brain motor systems', she explain to CrowdScience. For one study, Ms James bin recruit four-year-old wey no sabi how to write. For di laboratory, dem bin teach dis young volunteers one of three tins: how to complete strokes to form a letter, how to type a letter and how to write a letter. Wen dem complete di first part of di activity, dem go do MRI scan for dem. \"We bin show di children different letters while we bin dey scan dia brains. E reach one point, all dem need to do na to look di letters wey dem bin learn to make for di laboratory\", di neuroscientist describe. \"We observe say di children wey bin learn di letters by hand show brain activation for di areas wey dey linked to dis skills. No be so e be for di oda two groups, wey complete di strokes or type am\", she compare dem. But di relationship between writing and learning no stop for dere. Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images Ms James bin also assess students. Dia task na to attend a lecture for subject wey dem no sabi anytin about. Dem kon  fill one questionnaire on how well dem bin take  taken note of wetin di teacher bin teach dem. Di next day, all di volunteers bin take di test based on di content wey dem don teach dem. 'We bin compare di results of students wey bin take notes by hand, and wit computer or on tablet', she explain. Di neuroscientist explain say na common practice for American universities for lecturers to share slides wit students. And some of dem don get di habit of opening dis file on tablets and taking notes by hand, using digital pens, for di slides demsefs. 'For our work, di students wey bin use di tablet to write for di screen get beta results for di tests', di professor of psychology and neuroscience explains. \"We fit explainam by di fact say di students no only get di original material, for di slides, but dem fit also write dia own notes by hand. But writing wit pen and paper also prove beneficial. Di volunteers wey bin use dis method bin get beta results pass di pipo wey type dia notes for computer\", Karin Harman James add. In oda words, according to di latest available data, if you really want to learn somtin, di best tin to do na to write by hand, weda on paper or tablet. Wia dis foto come from, Getty Images But all dis debate bring us back to di discussion for di beginning of di article: Pipo wey dey write fit write beta so day pesin fit read am to understand and learn? As part of di CrowdScience programme, Cherrell Avery, one handwriting trainer for London (UK), bin give some advice wey fit prove useful. Her first piece of advice na to 'go slowly'. We dey write too fast and we no dey pay attention to di shape of letters and words. Ms Avery also add say di need to understand each pesin style, including di best writing utensil, na how to hold di pen/pencil, di right posture and di type of paper, among oda factors. For her opinion, e dey possible to improve your handwriting through exercise. 'Of course, one single training session no go reach to make significant changes,' she tok. But wit a little insistence, e dey possible to create a \"muscle memory\" wey dey encourage a new writing style. \"At first, na a conscious effort. But little by little, e go become a habit and you no go even think about dis new way of writing\", Cherrell Avery tok. Finally, Ms Avery say writing dey important to us, evritime becos e represent an 'extension of our personality'. \"E be like say we dey leave a bit of oursef for di page\".",

E say dia fighters torture and murder men wey dey try to run. Now for di town of Tawila wia e dey, Ezzeldin na one of di several thousand pipo wey make am to area wey dey safe small afta e escape wetin di UN don describe as \"horrific\" violence. On Wednesday, 29 October, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo bin admit to \"violations\" for el-Fasher and e say dem go investigate am. One day later, one UN senior official tok say RSF don give notice say dem don arrest some suspects. About 80km (50-mile) journey from el-Fasher, Tawila na one of di several places wia dos wey dey lucky enough to escape di RSF fighters dey run go. \"We comot el-Fasher four days ago. Di suffering we see for road dey unimaginable,\" Ezzeldin tok. \"Dem divide us into groups and beaten. Di scenes dey extremely brutal. We see as dem kill pipo for our front. We see as dem beat-beat pipo, E dey very terrible. \"Dem beat me for head, back, and legs. Dem beat me with sticks. Dem wan kill us finally. But wen di opportunity come, we run, but dem catch dos wey dey in front of us.\" Ezzeldin tok say im join one group of escapees wey bin take shelter inside one building, na night dem dey move and sometimes dem go just crawl for ground make nobody see dem. \"Dem tiff our belongings,\" e tok. \"Phones, clothes – everything, even my shoes dem tiff am. Nothing remain. \"For three days, we go chop as we dey waka for road. By God's mercy, we escape.\" Dos wey dey Tawila tell BBC say, RSF dey thoroughly question and investigate di men wey travel come, as di fighters dey target anyone dem suspect to be soja. Ezzeldin na one of around 5,000 pipo wey fit don land Tawila since di fall of el-Fasher on Sunday. Many of dem waka di entire journey wit dia legs, dem travel for three or four days to escape di violence. One freelance journalist for Tawila, wey dey work for BBC, bin follow some of those wey travel di journey tok. Close to Ezzeldin, Ahmed Ismail Ibrahim sidon, bandage full im body. E say one artillery strike injure am for eye, and e comot di city on Sunday afta e receive treatment for hospital. RSF fighters bin stop im and six oda men. \"Dem kill four of dem for our front. Dem beat and kill dem,\" e tok, e add say dem shoot am three times. Ahmed describe how di fighters order to see di phones of di three of dem wey still dey alive and dem go through dem, check dia messages. One fighter, e tok, finally tell dem say: \"OK, get up and go.\" Dem run enta bush. \"My brothers,\" e add, \"dem no leave me behind. \"We waka for about 10 minutes, den rest for 10 minutes, and we continue until we find peace now.\" For di next tent, na one clinic wey medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) dey operate, Yusra Ibrahim Mohamed describe how im make di decision to run comot di city afta dem kill her husband, wey be soja wit di Sudanese army. \"My husband bin dey di artillery,\" she tok. \"E bin dey return home bifor dem kill am during di attacks. \"We dey patient.

And wey dey try to give dem some support and some medical care.\" Di ones wey come dis week for Tawila bin join hundreds of thousands wey don run earlier from di violence for el-Fasher. Before di RSF seize am on Sunday, di city bin dey under hostage for 18 months. Dem bomb pipo wey dey trapped wit deadly artillery and air strikes as di army plus di paramilitaries battle for el-Fasher. Di RSF blockade of supplies and aid also put dem into serious hunger crisis. Hundreds of thousands bin dey displaced for April wen di RSF seize control of di Zamzam camp wey dey close to di city, at di time, one of di main sites wey dey house pipo wey dey forced to run.

Dem dey highly malnourished, highly dehydrated, or sick or injured, and dem clearly dey traumatised wit wetin dem don see either for di city or for road. \"We believe say many pipo currently dey hooked for different locations between Tawila and el-Fasher, and dem no fit move forward – weda bicos of dia physical condition or sake of di insecurity for di road, wia militias unfortunately dey attack pipo wey dey try to escape go find safe haven.\" For Ezzeldin, e no too happy say im escape di city sake of di fears e get for those wey still dey behind. \"My message na say make public roads dey safe for citizens,\" e beg, \"or make dem send humanitarian aid go di streets. \"Pipo dey for critical condition – dem no fit move, speak, or seek help. \"Aid suppose reach dem, bicos many dey miss and more dey suffer.\" Civil war break out for Sudan for April 2023 afta one violent struggle for power between dia army and one powerful paramilitary group, di Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Di war don lead to famine and claims of genocide for di western Darfur region - fears also dey for di residents of di city of el-Fasher afta RSF recently capture am. More dan 150,000 pipo don die for di conflict across di kontri, and about 12 million pipo don run comot dia homes for inside wetin di United Nations call di largest humanitarian crisis.",
